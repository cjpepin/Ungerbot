Repo for Ungerboeck 2022 Summer Interns


## To Run: 

1. Pull project contents
2. Make sure you have a MongoDB Community server running on localhost. Go [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) to download the server.
3. In Visual Studio, right click Solution 'Ungerbot'.
4. Click 'Properties'.
5. Click 'Multiple startup projects'.
6. Change both 'Backend' and 'Frontend' to start.
7. For the chat bot to function, the glove.6B.50d.txt file found [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) must be added into the Backend/TextClassification/Data directory. It is too big for github.
8. Press the big green 'Start' button!
